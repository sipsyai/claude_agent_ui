The README mentions this architecture but doesn't provide diagrams for data flow, service communication, or deployment topology.\n\n## Rationale\n\nNew developers and contributors need to understand the system architecture before making changes. The current project involves streaming SSE connections, MCP protocol interactions, and multi-service communication that aren't immediately obvious from code alone.\n\n---\n*This spec was created from ideation and is pending detailed specification.*\n",

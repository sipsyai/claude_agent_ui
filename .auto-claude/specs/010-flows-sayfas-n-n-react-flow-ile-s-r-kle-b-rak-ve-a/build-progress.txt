# React Flow Integration - Build Progress

## Status: In Progress - Phase 1

## Last Updated: 2026-01-02

---

## Summary
Transform the Flows page into a visual drag-and-drop workflow builder similar to n8n and Langchain, using React Flow for intuitive node-based workflow design.

## Implementation Plan Overview

### Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure (3 subtasks)
- [x] 1.1 Install React Flow Dependencies (@xyflow/react)
- [ ] 1.2 Create React Flow Types
- [ ] 1.3 Create Flow Canvas Context

### Phase 2: Custom Node Components (5 subtasks)
- [ ] 2.1 Create Base Node Component
- [ ] 2.2 Create Input Node Component
- [ ] 2.3 Create Agent Node Component
- [ ] 2.4 Create Output Node Component
- [ ] 2.5 Create Node Registry and Factory

### Phase 3: Flow Canvas Component (5 subtasks)
- [ ] 3.1 Create Node Palette Component
- [ ] 3.2 Create Flow Canvas Component
- [ ] 3.3 Create Custom Edge Component
- [ ] 3.4 Create Canvas Toolbar Component
- [ ] 3.5 Create Node Configuration Panel

### Phase 4: Flow Editor Integration (4 subtasks)
- [ ] 4.1 Create Flow Data Converter
- [ ] 4.2 Create Visual Flow Editor Page
- [ ] 4.3 Update Flow Editor Routing
- [ ] 4.4 Add Flow Validation

### Phase 5: Polish & Enhancements (5 subtasks)
- [ ] 5.1 Add Keyboard Shortcuts
- [ ] 5.2 Add Auto-Layout Algorithm
- [ ] 5.3 Add Connection Validation
- [ ] 5.4 Add Flow Preview Mode
- [ ] 5.5 Add CSS Styling and Theming

## Key Technical Decisions

### Library Choice: React Flow (@xyflow/react v12)
React Flow was selected as the primary library for the following reasons:
- Mature and well-documented
- Purpose-built for node-based editors
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Built-in features: drag-drop, zooming, panning, mini-map
- Large community and active maintenance
- Used by similar tools (n8n uses a custom implementation but React Flow is the standard)

### Alternative Libraries Considered
- **react-diagrams**: More complex, steeper learning curve
- **beautiful-dnd**: Not designed for graph editing
- **rete.js**: Steeper learning curve, more opinionated

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Custom Node Components**: Extend React Flow's base Node with custom styling
2. **Reuse Existing Components**: Node configuration panels will reuse InputNodeConfig, AgentNodeConfig, OutputNodeConfig
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Flow data structure will be preserved through conversion utilities
4. **No Backend Changes**: The existing backend API already supports the required node structure

## Estimated Timeline
- Total Estimated Hours: 38
- Target Completion: 2026-01-15
- Priority: High

## Dependencies
- @xyflow/react (React Flow v12) - Primary
- dagre (optional) - For auto-layout algorithm

## Progress Log

### 2026-01-02
- Created comprehensive implementation plan with 22 subtasks across 5 phases
- Analyzed existing codebase structure (FlowsPage, FlowEditorPage, FlowDetailPage)
- Identified reusable components (node config components)
- Selected React Flow as the primary library
- Planning phase complete

#### Subtask 1.1 - Install React Flow Dependencies ✓
- Successfully installed @xyflow/react v12.10.0
- Package includes 704 dependencies
- No dependency conflicts detected
- No security vulnerabilities found
- Verified TypeScript compatibility (pre-existing TS errors unrelated to React Flow)
- Updated package.json with new dependency
- Changes committed to git (commit: 56c7d9e)

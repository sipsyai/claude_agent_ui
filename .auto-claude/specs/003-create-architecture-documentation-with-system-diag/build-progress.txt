- [ ] 1.3 Analyze Docker & Deployment Architecture
- [ ] 1.4 Analyze MCP Protocol Integration

### Phase 2: Diagram Creation (5 subtasks)
- [ ] 2.1 Create High-Level System Architecture Diagram
- [ ] 2.2 Create Data Flow Diagram
- [ ] 2.3 Create Deployment Topology Diagram
- [ ] 2.4 Create Service Component Diagrams
- [ ] 2.5 Create Sequence Diagrams for Key Flows

### Phase 3: Documentation & Integration (4 subtasks)
- [ ] 3.1 Create Architecture Index & Overview
- [ ] 3.2 Create Technology Stack Reference
- [ ] 3.3 Update Main README with Architecture Section
- [ ] 3.4 Review and Finalize Documentation

## Architecture Components Identified

### Services (8 total):
1. React Frontend (Vite + Tailwind + Radix UI)
2. Express Backend (Business Logic + SSE)
3. Strapi CMS (Data Layer)
4. PostgreSQL Database
5. Claude SDK (AI Agent Execution)
6. MCP Protocol (Tool Integration)
7. Nginx (Reverse Proxy)
8. Docker Compose (Container Orchestration)

### Key Interactions to Document:
- SSE streaming for real-time agent execution
- REST API communication between Frontend → Express → Strapi
- MCP protocol for tool discovery and execution
- Docker network topology (frontend/backend networks)

## Session Notes

### 2026-01-02: Initial Planning
- Read spec.md and analyzed project structure
- Explored README.md, docker-compose.yml, and backend structure
- Identified all major components and their interactions
- Created comprehensive implementation_plan.json with 3 phases and 13 subtasks
- Estimated 6 hours total effort

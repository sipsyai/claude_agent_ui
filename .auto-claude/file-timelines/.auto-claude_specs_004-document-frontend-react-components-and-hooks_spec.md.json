None have prop documentation, usage examples, or component purpose descriptions. Custom hooks like useAgentCreator, useFlowState, and useSkillTraining lack documentation of their state management and side effects.\n\n## Rationale\n\nFrontend development requires understanding component APIs, prop types, and hook behavior. Currently developers must read implementation to understand how to use components like FlowDesigner, AgentExecutionModal, or TaskExecutionModal.\n\n---\n*This spec was created from ideation and is pending detailed specification.*\n",

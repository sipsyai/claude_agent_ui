# How to Use Service Request Management?

## Overview

The Service Request Management module helps organizations track and manage service requests raised by users. Examples include laptop requests, travel reimbursements, and employee onboarding processes. These requests are created through Service Catalogs, which streamline the initiation process.

You can implement Service Request Management using either out-of-the-box (OOB) catalogs or by creating custom ones.

## Using OOB Service Catalog

### Steps to Activate Predefined Catalogs

1. Navigate to **Admin Settings > Service Catalog** to view available out-of-the-box options. Filter by category as needed.

2. Open your desired service catalog and make necessary modifications:
   - Add custom fields to the form
   - Configure SLA rules
   - Design workflow processes
   - Set up approval workflows
   - Create associated tasks
   - Define scenarios
   - Establish service models
   - Create rules
   - Configure email notifications
   - Design print templates

3. Publish and update the catalog once configuration is complete.

4. The published catalog becomes available when creating new service requests.

5. Users can select the catalog to create service requests (e.g., for a new laptop).

## Creating a Service Catalog

### Creating Custom Service Catalogs

Click the **Add Service** button to create a new catalog:

1. Enter required details (e.g., for a Mobile Phone service)
2. Select **Create** to initialize the request
3. Edit the form to add design elements and rules

### Configuration Options

**Basic Settings:**
- Service Catalog Form
- SLA rules for resolution timelines
- Approval automation processes
- Associated tasks
- Stakeholder notifications
- Print templates

**Advanced Configurations:**
- **Workflows:** Automate ticket interactions and updates
- **Scenarios:** Modify tickets based on specific conditions
- **Form Rules:** Control field visibility, requirements, and enablement based on conditions
- **Custom Rules:** Enforce proper documentation for service request changes

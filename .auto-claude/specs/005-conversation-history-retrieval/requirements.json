  "task_description": "# Conversation History Retrieval\n\nImplement the ability to retrieve past conversations from the database, allowing users to resume previous agent sessions and review execution history.\n\n## Rationale\nCritical for session continuity. Without this, users lose context when refreshing or returning to the UI. Addresses the TODO in execution.routes.ts and mirrors functionality users expect from chat interfaces.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a developer, I want to view my past agent conversations so that I can review what was discussed and pick up where I left off\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Users can view a list of past conversations\n- [ ] Selecting a conversation loads the full message history\n- [ ] Conversation metadata (agent, timestamp, status) is displayed\n- [ ] Pagination works for conversations with many messages\n",

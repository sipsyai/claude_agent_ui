Add Node Operation:**\n- ✅ FloatingNodePalette positioned as absolute overlay (doesn't reduce canvas area)\n- ✅ Drag-drop from overlay to canvas working correctly\n- ✅ FlowCanvas.onDrop handler creates nodes via FlowCanvasContext.addNode\n- ✅ All three node types (Input, Agent, Output) created with proper default data\n- ✅ Unique ID generation and history tracking working\n\n**2. Connect Nodes Operation:**\n- ✅ FlowCanvas.onConnect handler creates edges via FlowCanvasContext.addEdge\n- ✅ Connection validation prevents cycles, self-connections, duplicates\n- ✅ Custom edge styling with primary color and animations\n- ✅ Unique edge ID generation and history tracking working\n\n**3. Edit Node Operation:**\n- ✅ Click node → handleNodeClick → opens NodeConfigPanel (slide-in from right)\n- ✅ Type-specific configuration components (InputNodeConfig, AgentNodeConfig, OutputNodeConfig)\n- ✅ Real-time updates via FlowCanvasContext.updateNode\n- ✅ Changes saved to history for undo/redo\n\n**4. Delete Node Operation:**\n- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Delete/Backspace) enabled via useFlowKeyboardShortcuts\n- ✅ FlowCanvas.onNodesChange handles removal via FlowCanvasContext.removeNode\n- ✅ Cascade deletion of connected edges working\n- ✅ History tracking for undo/redo\n\n**5. Save Flow Operation:**\n- ✅ Validation before save (requires at least one node, validates structure)\n- ✅ ReactFlow → Flow format conversion via reactFlowToFlow\n- ✅ Input/output schema generation from nodes\n- ✅ API calls include all node data (create or update)\n- ✅ Success/error toasts displayed\n\n**Layout Integration:**\n- ✅ FloatingNodePalette as overlay (absolute positioned, z-index above canvas)\n- ✅ Canvas occupies 80-90% width (flex-1 layout)\n- ✅ ConfigSidebar collapsible on left\n- ✅ NodeConfigPanel slide-in overlay on right\n- ✅ No layout conflicts with node operations\n\n**Data Flow:**\n- ✅ Load: Flow → ReactFlow format → FlowCanvasProvider\n- ✅ Edit: User operations → FlowCanvasContext → Auto-save debounce → handleCanvasChange\n- ✅ Save: ReactFlow format → Flow format → API → Success toast\n\n**No Regressions:**\n- ✅ All node operations work identically to previous layout\n- ✅ Same FlowCanvasContext, validation, API calls\n- ✅ Only UI positioning changed (FloatingNodePalette now overlay)\n- ✅ New layout provides MORE space for node operations\n\nDocumentation:\n- Created NODE_OPERATIONS_VERIFICATION.md with comprehensive analysis\n- Documented all 5 node operations with code references\n- Documented complete data flow (6 steps)\n- Documented layout integration verification\n- Included manual testing procedures (5 test cases)\n- Verified no regressions from previous implementation\n\nConclusion: All node operations (add, edit, delete, connect, save) are fully functional with the new canvas-first layout.

Save Blocking Mechanism:**\n- ✅ Early return statements prevent API calls when validation fails (lines 345, 354, 368)\n- ✅ Three validation layers: name check, node count check, flow structure validation\n- ✅ Save operation (setSaving(true)) only executed after all validations pass (line 371)\n- ✅ No database writes when validation errors exist\n\n**3. Save Button Disabled State:**\n- ✅ Button disabled when validationResult.hasErrors is true (line 717)\n- ✅ Tooltip shows \"Fix validation errors before saving\" when disabled (line 719)\n- ✅ Visual feedback: grayed-out button appearance\n- ✅ Real-time updates via handleCanvasChange callback (lines 303-307)\n- ✅ Re-enables automatically when errors resolved\n\n**4. Validation State Management:**\n- ✅ validationResult state declared with ExtendedFlowValidationResult type (line 213)\n- ✅ Updated via validateFlow function on canvas changes\n- ✅ hasErrors computed property tracks error state\n- ✅ Save button reactively disabled based on state\n\n**5. Toast System Integration:**\n- ✅ ToastContext provides addToast function\n- ✅ ToastProvider wraps application with global state\n- ✅ Toast stacking with max limit (5 toasts)\n- ✅ Success toast on successful save\n- ✅ Error toast on API failures\n\n**6. No Inline Banners:**\n- ✅ All inline error displays removed in Phase 4 (subtask-4-4)\n- ✅ Validation messages exclusively shown as toasts\n- ✅ Canvas area unaffected by validation messages\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Created VALIDATION_TOAST_VERIFICATION.md with comprehensive analysis\n- Documented all validation checks and error messages\n- Documented save blocking mechanisms\n- Documented save button disabled state logic\n- Included 6 manual test cases for E2E verification\n- Verified no regressions from previous implementation\n\n**Conclusion:** All validation messages appear as toasts in the top-right corner. Save is blocked when errors exist via early returns AND disabled save button. No issues found.",

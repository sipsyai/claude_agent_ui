      "description": "Implement ESC key handling and focus trap for the Dialog component to improve accessibility and user experience",
      "rationale": "The Dialog component currently only closes via backdrop click. Users expect to close modals with the ESC key, which is a standard UX pattern and WCAG accessibility requirement. Focus should also be trapped within the dialog while open.",
      "category": "accessibility",
      "affected_components": ["src/web/manager/components/ui/Dialog.tsx"],
      "screenshots": [],
      "current_state": "Dialog component renders a backdrop that closes on click, but has no keyboard event listeners. No ESC key handling, no focus trap implementation. The component just renders children without trapping keyboard focus inside.",
      "proposed_change": "1. Add useEffect hook to listen for 'keydown' events on document\n2. Close dialog when ESC key is pressed (event.key === 'Escape')\n3. Add focus trap using useRef to track focusable elements\n4. On open, focus the first focusable element\n5. On Tab, cycle through focusable elements within dialog\n6. Add aria-modal='true' and role='dialog' to DialogContent\n7. Clean up event listeners on unmount",
      "user_benefit": "Users can close dialogs with ESC key as expected. Screen reader users get proper modal semantics. Keyboard-only users can navigate within the dialog without focus escaping to background content.",

      "rationale": "The AssistantMessage component displays debug information (line 446-448) that shows 'View: {viewMode} | Tools: {allToolUses.length} | System: {allSystemMessages.length} | Status: {message?.status?.type}' directly in the UI. This is development-only information that should not be visible to end users.",

      "proposed_change": "1. Remove the debug div entirely (lines 446-448) from MessageBubble.tsx\n2. Alternatively, wrap in a conditional that checks process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' if debug info is needed during development\n3.

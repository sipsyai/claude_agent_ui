    "pain_points": [
      "Managing Claude agents via CLI or configuration files is cumbersome and error-prone",
      "No visual way to see agent configurations, skills, and their relationships",
      "Difficulty tracking which skills are used by which agents",
      "MCP server configuration scattered across multiple files",
      "No centralized interface for testing and executing agents",
      "Lack of real-time visibility into agent execution",

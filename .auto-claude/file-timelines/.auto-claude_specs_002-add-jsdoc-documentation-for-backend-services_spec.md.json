Most lack proper JSDoc documentation. Critical services like ClaudeSdkService, MCPService, and strapiClient have minimal inline documentation, making it difficult for developers to understand function parameters, return types, and usage patterns.\n\n## Rationale\n\nBackend services are the core of the application. Developers frequently need to understand how services interact with Claude SDK, Strapi, and MCP servers. Without JSDoc, developers must read implementation details to understand function behavior.\n\n---\n*This spec was created from ideation and is pending detailed specification.*\n",

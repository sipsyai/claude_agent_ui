      "description": "The Button component is missing commonly used variants like 'outline' and 'ghost'. The AgentsPage already attempts to use variant='outline' but this variant doesn't exist in the component definition.",
      "rationale": "Consistent button variants are essential for visual hierarchy. Outline buttons are commonly used for secondary actions and ghost buttons for subtle interactions. Without these, developers may create inconsistent inline styles.",
      "category": "visual",
      "affected_components": ["src/web/manager/components/ui/Button.tsx", "src/web/manager/components/AgentsPage.tsx"],
      "screenshots": [],
      "current_state": "Button component only has 3 variants: 'primary', 'secondary', 'destructive'. AgentsPage uses 'variant=\"outline\"' which is not defined, causing fallback to primary styling.",
      "proposed_change": "Add 'outline' and 'ghost' variants to Button.tsx: outline: 'border border-input bg-background hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground', ghost: 'hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground'. This aligns with shadcn/ui patterns already used in the project.",
      "user_benefit": "Proper visual hierarchy for actions, consistent appearance across the app, and clearer distinction between primary and secondary actions.",

      "description": "The Dialog component lacks proper ARIA attributes for accessibility. It's missing role='dialog', aria-modal='true', aria-labelledby, and focus trapping.",
      "rationale": "Modal dialogs without proper ARIA attributes are inaccessible to screen reader users. Users may not understand they're in a dialog, can't escape it properly, and focus may escape to background content.",

      "current_state": "Dialog component uses simple div elements without ARIA roles. The backdrop onClick closes the modal but there's no keyboard escape handler. Focus is not trapped within the dialog.",
      "proposed_change": "Add role='dialog', aria-modal='true', aria-labelledby pointing to DialogTitle. Add onKeyDown handler for Escape key. Implement focus trap using useEffect to capture and restore focus. Consider using @radix-ui/react-dialog which is already a dependency.",
      "user_benefit": "Screen reader users can understand they're in a modal dialog, keyboard users can escape with Escape key, and focus remains within the dialog until closed.",

Add quick action buttons for 'New Chat', 'Create Agent', 'Create Skill'. Consider adding recent activity feed showing last 5 actions. Use existing Card components and API endpoints already available.",

      "proposed_change": "Create a ConfirmDialog component using the existing Dialog component. Implement a toast notification system for success/error messages (could use @radix-ui/react-toast or similar). Replace all alert() calls with toast notifications and all confirm() calls with the ConfirmDialog component.",

      "description": "Implemented exponential backoff polling mechanism for API calls. Uses dynamic setTimeout-based polling instead of fixed setInterval. On success, resets retry count and polls every 30 seconds. On error, increases delay exponentially: 5s \u2192 10s \u2192 20s. Stops after 3 failed attempts. Properly cleans up timeout in useEffect cleanup function to prevent memory leaks.",
